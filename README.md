# KuDoo
Language Interaction For Millenials

KuDoo is a real-time chat application with the aim of providing a low-stress environment to practice 'chatting' with other language learners.

This is a project that is currently under development. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or are interested in contributing or becoming a beta tester.
